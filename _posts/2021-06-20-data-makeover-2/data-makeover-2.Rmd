In this article, we will rethink and rework a data visualisation of bobble chart of [*"MERCHANDISE TRADE PERFORMANCE
WITH MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS, 2020"*](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade) provided by prof Kam.

The data is provided by [*Department of Statisticcs, Singapore DOS*](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data).

This is the original visualisation:

# 1. Critique of Visualization

## 1.1 Clarity

**1.**
The coordinate unit is not indicated in the horizontal and vertical coordinates and the title. Although it can be inferred from the comments that it is S Dollar, Billion. But clear labeling obviously makes it easier for readers to understand.

**2.**
Lack of display of net exports and net imports. The author selected the first place based on net exports and net imports. However, there are neither figures nor reference lines in the figure. It is difficult for readers to see the data of a certain trading partnerâ€™s net exports or net imports from the figure. It is therefore difficult to understand what the author chose the first place based on.

**3.**
It is not possible to find a conclusion based on the known data. Below the graph, the author writes the conclusion Since 2009, the value of exports exceeds imports for Singapore's merchandise trade with Mainland China. However, the author can neither draw this conclusion from the graph nor write an external link to support his conclusion.

## 1.2 Aesthetic

**1.**
Because the white center is too small compared to the colored circles, it is difficult to see the specific location of the white center, and it is difficult to find whether the center is at the upper left or lower right of the diagonal, so it is difficult to determine whether the trading partner is a NET EXPORTER Still net importer.

**2.**
The circle is too large, causing the circle and the circle to block each other, and some circles are blocked by more than 75%.

**3.**
 Interaction is almost useless in this picture. We cannot get more or more accurate data through mutual operations.
 
 #  2. Alternative Design
## 2.1 draft
the design is drawn as a draft:
